International Joint Workshop on Ontologies, Semantic Maps and Autonomous Robotics Standardization (J-WOSMARS 2025) @ [RO-MAN 2025](https://www.ro-man2025.org/), **August 29**, Enindhoven, the Netherlands.

This workshop is a joint workshop of the 4th edition of the Workshop on Ontologies and Standards for Robotics and Automation [WOSRA 2025](https://wosra.github.io/wosra/) and the 1st edition of the Workshop on Standardization of Semantic Maps for Autonomous Robots. 


**Location:** Campus of Eindhoven University of Technology ***(Atlas building, Room 2.215)***, Eindhoven, the Netherlands 



**SCOPE**

The development of applications in which robots and humans interact and communicate is flourishing both in research and industrial environments, raising new challenges and issues. In this context, ontological formalization, semantic maps generation and standardization emerge as essential elements for shaping a hybrid future with robots that reliably collaborate with and/or assist humans. Related to interaction, it is essential the creation of semantic maps that incorporate contextual and meaningful environmental information. In this context, it is also crucial to identify the best practices and requirements for designing and executing human-subject studies in human-robot interaction. Regarding communication, a vocabulary with clear and concise definitions (e.g. ontologies) is a sine qua non component to enable information exchange among any group of agents (e.g. semantic map sharing, beliefs, plans, etc.), which can be human or non-human actors (e.g. robots). 

Established and shared vocabularies, semantic maps and practices play a relevant role when legal and ethical aspects are at stake. Hence, the creation of new robotic standards and specifically semantic map and ontological standards for robots is of utter importance to help with robot certification and safe and ethical design. Hence, this workshop aims to increase interest in standardization for the Robotics and Automation (R&A) domain, focusing on semantic maps generation, human-robot studies and ontology formalization. In this context, the workshop will also discuss the challenges involved with the interaction between humans and robots. 



**IMPORTANT DATES**

- Submission deadline: **June 15** 
- Notification: **July 1**
- Camera ready: **August 1** (details on 'Accepted papers' page)
- Workshop: **August 29**


**CALL FOR PAPERS**

Participants are invited to submit extended abstract papers of 2+n pages (n pages for references), or short papers of 4+n pages (IEEE format) for poster presentation in person at RO-MAN in Eindhoven. Contributions shall be submitted through the EasyChair conference system ([submission link](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=jwosmars2025)). Extended abstracts shall focus on insights on new or ongoing projects on ontologies. The goal is to foster engaging technical and scientific discussions among researchers and cultivate new collaborations. Short papers shall discuss previous or on-going research, preliminary results, use cases. The aim is to disseminate to the community research works but also encourage fruitful discussions on open problems and novel ideas.

All papers will be peer-reviewed (single-blind) and published on our website with the permission of authors. Submissions shall focus on subjects including but not limited to the following topics:
